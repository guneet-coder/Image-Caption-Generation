# Image-Caption-Generation
In Image Caption Generation concepts of Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing are
applied to recognize the context of image and describe the context of Image in some Natural
Language like English and using Machine Translation and NaturalLanguage Processing the
caption can be described in domain language.
In this project our objective will be to train the model to maximize the likelihood of the target
description sentence for a given training image.
